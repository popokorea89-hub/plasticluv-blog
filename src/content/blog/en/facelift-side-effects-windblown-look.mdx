For most patients considering facial rejuvenation, the deepest concern is rarely about the surgery itself. It is about the outcome. The most common fear sounds something like this: *"I want to look younger — but I absolutely do not want to look like I've had work done."*

This is an entirely reasonable concern. According to the [American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS)](https://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/facelift), facelifts remain one of the most sought-after aesthetic procedures worldwide — yet for decades, mainstream media has spotlighted the worst examples: faces that appear perpetually startled, artificially stretched, or unmistakably "done." These images linger in the collective memory and, understandably, give pause to anyone considering the procedure.

But here is what most patients don't realize: the unnatural "windblown" look is not an inherent risk of facelift surgery. It is the predictable consequence of an outdated surgical philosophy. Modern techniques — specifically the [Deep Plane Facelift](/en/blog/deep-plane-facelift-vs-smas) — have fundamentally changed what is achievable. Understanding exactly why some facelifts go wrong is the first step toward avoiding the same outcome.

## The Anatomy of an Unnatural Face: Why Do Some Facelifts Look Fake?

To understand the problem, it helps to examine how older facelift techniques were performed — and why they produced results that, over time, betrayed themselves.

Historically, "skin-only" facelifts and early SMAS plication techniques relied on a deceptively simple strategy: pull the skin tight enough to smooth out the wrinkles, then trim away the excess. On paper, it sounds logical. In practice, it ignores a fundamental anatomical truth.

**Skin is an elastic covering — not a structural foundation.** It was never designed to bear the cumulative weight of descending fat pads, loosened fascia, and sagging musculature. When the skin alone is asked to carry that burden, the result is a face that looks *tightened* rather than *rejuvenated*. And over time, several characteristic deformities emerge.

### 1. The "Wind Tunnel" or "Lateral Sweep" Effect

In older techniques, the vector of pull is predominantly lateral — sideways toward the ears — rather than vertical, which is the direction that actually reverses gravitational descent. This horizontal tension flattens the natural convexity of the cheeks, widens the commissure of the mouth, and produces that unmistakable swept-back, windblown appearance — as though the patient is perpetually standing in front of a powerful fan. The face appears *stretched* rather than *restored*, because it has been pulled in the wrong direction entirely.

### 2. The Pixie Ear Deformity

Because the skin is placed under significant tension at its anchor points, the healing process works against the repair. As tissues settle and gravity reasserts itself, the earlobe — which should remain freely detached and naturally rounded — gets dragged downward and forward, stretching into the jawline. This elongated, adherent earlobe is known as a "pixie ear," and it remains one of the most recognizable telltale signs of a poorly executed facelift. For many patients, it is the detail that makes them self-conscious about wearing their hair up or simply turning their head in conversation.

### 3. Distorted Facial Expressions

When the skin is pulled taut over the underlying musculature without repositioning the muscles themselves, it acts as a restrictive membrane. Natural facial expressions — smiling, laughing, even the subtle microexpressions that convey warmth — become muted, stiff, or asymmetric. The face may look acceptable at rest, yet the moment the patient animates, something feels unmistakably *off*.

## The Deep Plane Difference: Moving Beyond the Skin

The key insight of modern facial rejuvenation is that aging is not a surface phenomenon. It is a three-dimensional, structural process driven by the progressive descent of the **SMAS** (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System) — the deep layer of muscle and connective tissue that forms the true scaffold of the face. Wrinkles and skin laxity are merely the visible downstream effects.

The Deep Plane Facelift addresses aging at its source.

Instead of separating the skin from the SMAS and pulling each layer independently, the Deep Plane approach goes *beneath* the SMAS into a naturally occurring avascular corridor. From this deeper plane, the surgeon meticulously releases the facial retaining ligaments — the zygomatic and masseteric ligaments — that tether the aging soft tissues to the underlying bone. Once these strong fibrous anchors are freed, the entire composite — fat, muscle, and skin together — can be gently elevated as a single, unified flap and repositioned along a vertical vector that faithfully reverses the effects of gravity.

The skin is never pulled. It simply *redrapes* over a beautifully restored structural foundation.

A peer-reviewed study published in [*Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery*](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/) confirmed that deep plane techniques produce significantly greater midface elevation with longer-lasting structural support compared to traditional skin-tension approaches — reinforcing what surgeons increasingly observe in clinical practice.

## Why a Deep Plane Facelift Produces a Natural Outcome

When the surgical philosophy shifts from tightening skin to repositioning structure, every characteristic problem of older techniques is eliminated:

### Zero Skin Tension

The heavy lifting is performed entirely by the robust SMAS layer. The skin bears no load whatsoever — it is closed without tension, which means it heals with fine, imperceptible scars and never develops the taut, shiny quality that betrays surgical intervention.

### No Pixie Ears or Widened Scars

Tension-free closure preserves the earlobe in its natural, rounded anatomical position. Incisions placed within the hairline and the contours of the ear heal into virtually invisible lines — a stark contrast to the widened, thickened scars that are an unfortunate hallmark of skin-tension facelifts.

### Preserved Facial Dynamics

Because the skin and SMAS are elevated together as a single unit — rather than being separated and independently tensioned — the relationship between muscle and overlying tissue remains intact. Every smile, every laugh, every raised eyebrow moves exactly as it always has. The result is a face that looks refreshed, never frozen.

### Vertical Volumetric Restoration

The Deep Plane lift vertically repositions the descended cheek fat pads back to the midface, restoring the youthful "apple" of the cheek with the patient's own native tissue. This natural volumetric correction often eliminates the need for excessive synthetic fillers or supplemental fat grafting — achieving fullness that looks and feels authentic rather than inflated.

## Can a Botched "Windblown" Facelift Be Fixed?

Many patients seek revision surgery because they are living with the stretched, unnatural results of a previous facelift performed elsewhere. The reassuring news is that **revision is possible, and the outcomes can be transformative.**

The Deep Plane approach is uniquely suited for revision cases. By re-entering the deeper anatomical planes, the surgeon can carefully release the scar tissue and adhesions left by the prior surgery, decompress the skin that has been held under chronic tension, and correctly reposition the SMAS to its proper anatomical location. Pixie ear deformities can be corrected, lateral distortion can be resolved, and a soft, natural facial contour can be restored — often exceeding the patient's expectations of what a revision could achieve.

If you are considering revision surgery, [consulting with a board-certified surgeon experienced in Deep Plane techniques](/en/consultation) is the most important first step.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long until the face looks completely natural after a Deep Plane Facelift?**

Most patients feel socially presentable and comfortable returning to daily routines within two to three weeks. However, the tissues continue to mature and settle well beyond that initial window. The truly final result — soft, completely natural, and settled into its permanent position — typically emerges around the three-to-six-month mark as residual deep swelling fully resolves and the repositioned tissues integrate seamlessly with the surrounding anatomy.

**Will a facelift change the shape of the eyes or mouth?**

A properly executed Deep Plane Facelift respects the patient's unique facial architecture. The surgical vectors are directed vertically to lift the lower face, jawline, and midface — not laterally. This means the corners of the mouth are not pulled sideways, and the shape of the eyes remains entirely unaltered. The goal is always to restore the patient's own face, not to create a different one.

**Can a previous "windblown" facelift be corrected with a Deep Plane revision?**

Yes. The Deep Plane technique is particularly effective for revision cases because it works beneath the scar tissue left by the original surgery. By releasing deep adhesions and repositioning the SMAS along a vertical vector, a skilled surgeon can relieve chronic skin tension, correct pixie ear deformities, and restore a soft, natural contour — even after a previous unsatisfactory result.

**Am I too young to get a Deep Plane Facelift to prevent aging?**

There is no universally "perfect" age for a facelift — the decision depends entirely on individual anatomy and the degree of visible aging. That said, many patients in their late 40s and early 50s are choosing the Deep Plane approach because addressing tissue laxity at an earlier stage often yields the most seamless, enduring, and natural-appearing results. Early intervention allows the surgeon to work with tissues that still retain favorable elasticity and blood supply, which contributes to both superior healing and exceptional longevity.

## The Takeaway

An unnatural face is never the inevitable consequence of having a facelift. It is the consequence of having the *wrong type* of facelift — one that relies on skin tension rather than structural repositioning. When the surgeon respects the complex, layered anatomy of the face and addresses aging at its deeper root, the results are not merely acceptable — they are seamless and elegant.

The goal of modern anti-aging surgery is never to change who a person looks like. It is to restore the rested, vibrant version that has always been there, beneath the surface.

Choosing the right technique and an experienced, board-certified surgeon is the single most important decision for anyone considering facial rejuvenation.
