The art and science of facial rejuvenation have advanced remarkably over the past several decades. For patients seeking a definitive solution to the visible signs of aging, the facelift — or rhytidectomy — remains the undisputed gold standard in aesthetic surgery. Yet it is important to recognize that not all facelifts deliver the same caliber of results. Today, the global plastic surgery community and discerning patients alike draw a clear distinction between two primary techniques: the **Traditional SMAS Facelift** and the **Deep Plane Facelift**.

According to the [American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS)](https://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/facelift), facelift procedures have consistently ranked among the most sought-after aesthetic surgeries worldwide — and the demand for more refined, longer-lasting outcomes continues to grow.

Understanding the anatomical principles, anticipated recovery timelines, and long-term outcomes of each method is essential for making a truly informed decision. Grounded in clinical evidence and the expertise of Dr. Yongwoo Lee at [VIP Plastic Surgery](https://www.vippskorea.com) in Seoul, this guide illuminates the science behind both procedures.

## Understanding the Anatomy: The "Bedding" Analogy

To appreciate the difference between facelift techniques, one must first understand the SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System) — a fibromuscular layer situated beneath the skin, composed of muscle fibers and connective tissue that serves as the structural foundation of the face.

Surgeons often illustrate this concept with a simple yet effective analogy: **Think of your facial architecture as a bed.**

- The **skin** is the blanket.
- The **SMAS layer** is the mattress.

When a mattress begins to sag over the years, merely pulling the blanket tighter will never restore the underlying form — it will only create unnatural tension across the surface. To genuinely recapture a youthful, harmonious contour, the mattress (SMAS) itself must be elevated and repositioned.

## The Traditional SMAS Facelift: The Established Approach

The traditional SMAS facelift has served as the cornerstone of facial rejuvenation surgery for decades and continues to deliver excellent outcomes for appropriately selected patients.

- **How it works:** The surgeon carefully separates the skin (the blanket) from the underlying SMAS layer (the mattress). The SMAS is then tightened — either by folding it upon itself (plication) or by excising a measured segment and securing it with sutures (imbrication). The skin is subsequently re-draped over this refined foundation, and any redundant tissue is precisely removed.
- **Best suited for:** Patients presenting with mild to moderate facial aging who seek improved definition along the lower face and jawline.

Because the skin is elevated independently of the SMAS, the tension required to achieve visible correction is distributed primarily across the skin's surface. This mechanical reality can sometimes produce a slightly "taut" appearance, particularly in patients with advanced tissue laxity. Nevertheless, in skilled hands and for the right candidate, the traditional SMAS technique delivers reliable, gratifying results.

## The Deep Plane Facelift: The Science Behind Natural-Looking Results

The Deep Plane Facelift represents a more advanced, technically demanding procedure that addresses the deeper structural layers of the face — delivering what many consider the most natural-looking and enduring results available today.

- **How it works:** Rather than separating the skin from the SMAS, the surgeon enters a deeper anatomical space *beneath* the SMAS layer — the so-called "deep plane." The skin and SMAS are elevated together as a single, unified composite flap, preserving the integrity of the tissue's blood supply throughout the procedure.
- **Releasing the retaining ligaments:** The defining step of the deep plane technique is the meticulous release of the facial retaining ligaments — specifically the zygomatic and masseteric ligaments. These fibrous structures anchor the facial soft tissues firmly to the underlying bone. By carefully releasing them, the surgeon can reposition the entire midface and lower face volumetrically, restoring youthful projection against the pull of gravity.
- **Why the results appear more natural:** Because the retaining ligaments are released, the repositioned tissues settle into place without residual tension. This principle of "tension-free healing" eliminates the risk of the telltale "windblown" or overly taut appearance. Patients retain full, uninhibited natural mobility of their facial expressions — whether smiling, laughing, or speaking.

A peer-reviewed study published in [Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/) demonstrated that deep plane techniques produce significantly greater midface elevation with longer-lasting structural support compared to traditional SMAS approaches — reinforcing what many surgeons observe in their clinical practice.

## Ideal Candidates: Which Technique Matches Your Anatomy?

The optimal facelift technique depends on each patient's unique anatomical presentation, degree of aging, and aesthetic goals. There is no universal "best" procedure — only the best procedure for the individual.

**The Traditional SMAS Facelift may be ideal if you have:**

- Mild to moderate jowling with reasonably good skin elasticity
- Aging confined primarily to the lower face and jawline
- A preference for a shorter operative time and a well-established technique

**The Deep Plane Facelift may be ideal if you have:**

- Moderate to advanced facial descent, including significant midface volume loss
- Deep nasolabial folds, pronounced jowling, or submental laxity
- A desire for comprehensive, long-lasting rejuvenation that addresses the midface, lower face, and jawline simultaneously
- Concerns about achieving an overtly "surgical" appearance — the tension-free repositioning of the deep plane technique minimizes this risk

During consultation, Dr. Lee evaluates each patient's facial anatomy — including skin quality, subcutaneous fat distribution, bone structure, and the degree of ligamentous laxity — to recommend the technique most likely to produce an outstanding, natural outcome.

> **Dr. Lee's Clinical Note:** "In my experience, the deep plane technique is not merely a surgical refinement — it is a fundamentally different philosophy. By releasing the retaining ligaments and repositioning the entire composite flap as a unit, we restore what gravity has displaced rather than simply tightening what remains."

## Swelling and Recovery: The Avascular Plane Advantage

A common misconception holds that a "deeper" surgical approach necessarily translates to a longer, more arduous recovery. From an anatomical standpoint, the opposite is frequently true with the deep plane facelift.

- **Minimized bleeding and bruising:** The space between the skin and the SMAS is highly vascular — densely populated with blood vessels. Separating these layers during a traditional SMAS lift can result in more intraoperative bleeding and subsequent postoperative bruising. By contrast, the deep plane is an **avascular plane** — a naturally occurring gliding space with remarkably few blood vessels. Dissecting through this corridor produces significantly less tissue trauma and vascular disruption.
- **Recovery timeline:** While every patient's healing journey is unique, those undergoing a deep plane facelift often experience noticeably less postoperative bruising and can typically resume normal social activities within 10 to 14 days.

## Step-by-Step Recovery: What to Expect After Surgery

Understanding the recovery trajectory helps patients plan ahead with confidence.

- **Days 1–3 (Acute Phase):** Moderate swelling and mild bruising are expected. A compression garment is worn continuously to support the tissues. Most patients manage discomfort with prescribed oral analgesics and cold compresses.
- **Days 4–7 (Early Healing):** Bruising begins to fade from deep purple to yellow-green. Sutures placed in front of the ears may be removed during this period. Light walking is encouraged to promote circulation.
- **Weeks 2–3 (Social Reentry):** The majority of visible swelling has subsided. Most patients feel comfortable returning to work and social engagements. Residual firmness in the tissues is normal and resolves gradually.
- **Months 1–3 (Maturation):** The final contour continues to refine as residual deep swelling resolves and tissues settle into their new position. Sensation in the cheeks and jawline returns progressively.
- **Month 6 and Beyond:** The result is fully mature. Patients enjoy their rejuvenated appearance with natural facial expressions and restored volume.

## Longevity: A Long-Term Investment in Rejuvenation

Both techniques deliver meaningful, lasting anti-aging benefits — yet the durability of their results differs considerably, owing to fundamental differences in structural approach.

- **Traditional SMAS:** Results generally endure for approximately 7 to 10 years. Because the skin is elevated independently, there is an inherent tendency for gradual tissue re-laxity over time.
- **Deep Plane:** Offers superior longevity, with results often lasting 10 to 15 years or more. By repositioning the deeper muscular and adipose layers — rather than relying on skin tension alone — the structural integrity of the lift is preserved far longer. This technique is particularly effective at resolving deep nasolabial folds and comprehensively rejuvenating the midface.

## Safety, Risks, and Choosing a Qualified Surgeon

As with all surgical procedures, both facelift techniques carry inherent risks, including hematoma, infection, temporary numbness, and unfavorable scarring. However, when performed by a board-certified plastic surgeon with extensive facelift experience, the incidence of serious complications is low.

Key considerations when selecting your surgeon:

- **Board certification:** Ensure your surgeon holds current certification from a recognized national board of plastic surgery — such as the Korean Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Board of Plastic Surgery.
- **Deep plane–specific experience:** The deep plane technique demands advanced anatomical knowledge and refined surgical dexterity. Ask about the number of deep plane procedures the surgeon performs annually.
- **Hospital accreditation:** Your procedure should take place in an accredited surgical facility with full resuscitation capabilities and a qualified anesthesia team.
- **Transparent communication:** A trustworthy surgeon will discuss both the benefits and the limitations of each technique — and will recommend the approach best suited to your anatomy, not the one most frequently marketed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Am I too young for a Deep Plane Facelift?**

While facelifts have traditionally been associated with patients in their 50s and 60s, an increasing number of patients in their 40s — experiencing early midface descent and emerging jowling — are choosing the deep plane approach. Addressing these changes at an earlier stage can yield remarkably subtle, natural-looking refinements that age gracefully over time.

**Will I have visible scars?**

Incisions for both techniques are meticulously placed within the hairline and the natural contours around the ears. With precise surgical execution and a dedicated postoperative scar management protocol, these incisions mature into virtually imperceptible lines over the following months.

**How long should international patients plan to stay in Korea for recovery?**

For medical travelers, a minimum stay of 10 to 14 days in Korea is generally recommended. This timeframe allows for suture removal, the initial resolution of swelling, and essential postoperative follow-up consultations — ensuring a safe and comfortable transition before air travel. [VIP Plastic Surgery](https://www.vippskorea.com) offers dedicated international patient coordination to help plan your visit from start to finish.

**Can a Deep Plane Facelift change the shape of my eyes?**

The deep plane facelift does not directly alter the shape, size, or position of the eyes. However, by lifting the midface soft tissues and restoring volume to the cheek region, some patients notice a subtle improvement in under-eye hollowing or the appearance of a more refreshed, open periorbital area. For patients seeking more targeted rejuvenation around the eyes, Dr. Lee may recommend combining the facelift with a lower blepharoplasty — a procedure that directly addresses under-eye bags and excess skin.

**Can I combine a Deep Plane Facelift with Ultherapy or other non-surgical treatments?**

Many patients choose to complement their surgical results with non-surgical treatments such as Ultherapy (focused ultrasound), radiofrequency skin tightening, or medical-grade skincare. These modalities can be introduced several months after surgery — once the tissues have fully healed — to maintain skin quality, stimulate residual collagen production, and extend the longevity of surgical outcomes. Dr. Lee develops individualized maintenance plans that integrate both surgical and non-surgical strategies.
